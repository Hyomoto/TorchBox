> Tinder is a minimalist scripting language for building interactive logic, scenes, and event-driven flows in Python applications.

- Clear PEG-based syntax: Easy to read, easy to parse, and simple to extend.
- Supports structured and unstructured logic: Use blocks (if, for, foreach) or explicit jumps and labels.
- Ideal for games, dialogue engines, and narrative scripting: Designed for clarity, determinism, and control.
